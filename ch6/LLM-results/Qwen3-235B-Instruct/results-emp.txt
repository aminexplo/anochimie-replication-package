**Analysis:**  
- The flagged anomalies indicate that users are entering data in unintended fields due to missing functionality in the employee onboarding form. Key issues include:  
  - **Missing A/C option** in the Workplace Amenities field, leading users to substitute it with "Fan" or note it in feedback.
  - **Multiple phone numbers** being concatenated into the single PhoneNumber field because no additional fields exist.
  - **Senior/Junior role prefixes** (e.g., "SENIOR Data Scientist") manually entered despite not being part of the official dropdown options.
  - **Imprecise job start dates** (e.g., “in three years”) being converted to estimated future dates due to lack of flexible date input.
  - **Inconsistent UniformColor selection** using hex codes from a palette, making it difficult to standardize entries.
  - **Feedback field misuse** to record systemic data gaps (e.g., missing A/C, extra phone numbers, role levels), indicating the form lacks structured fields for this information.

These entries were flagged as anomalies because they violate expected data formats (e.g., multiple numbers in phone field, non-standard position titles, invalid amenities) and use free-text feedback to compensate for missing form capabilities.

**Potential User Workarounds:**  
- Concatenating multiple phone numbers into the PhoneNumber field using separators like hyphens or pipes.  
- Using the OverallFeedback field to list missing data (e.g., A/C requests, secondary phone numbers, role levels).  
- Manually typing "SENIOR" or "JUNIOR" in the PositionTitle field despite it not being a dropdown option.  
- Substituting "Fan" for "A/C" in WorkplaceAmenities to reflect cooling needs.  
- Entering estimated future dates for imprecise start times (e.g., “in three years” → 2030).  
- Arbitrarily selecting colors from a palette and attempting consistency across entries, despite lack of standardized options.

**Feature Request:**  
Title: Enhance Employee Onboarding Form to Support Flexible Role Levels, Multiple Contacts, and Expanded Amenities  

**Description:**  
The current employee onboarding form lacks essential fields and flexibility, forcing users to employ workarounds that compromise data integrity. Critical missing features include:
- Support for **multiple phone numbers** per employee.
- A dedicated option for **A/C** in WorkplaceAmenities.
- Structured selection for **role levels** (e.g., Junior, Senior) separate from job titles.
- Standardized **uniform color selection** via dropdown instead of freeform palette input.
- Flexible **job start date entry**, including relative dates or placeholders for undetermined dates.

These gaps result in inconsistent data entry, misuse of feedback fields, and potential loss of important employee preferences.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Users should be able to enter **primary and secondary phone numbers** in designated fields.
- The **WorkplaceAmenities** field should include "Air Conditioning (A/C)" as a selectable option.
- The **PositionTitle** field should be paired with a **Role Level** dropdown (e.g., Junior, Mid-Level, Senior) to standardize role classification.
- **UniformColor** should be selected from a predefined list of standard colors (e.g., Blue, Red, Green, Black, White) instead of an open color palette.
- The **JobStartDate** field should support estimated or relative dates (e.g., “In 3 years”) with an option to mark as “TBD” or auto-calculate based on relative input.
- All structured data should be captured in dedicated fields, eliminating the need to store critical information in free-text feedback.
