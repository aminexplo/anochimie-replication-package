**Analysis:**

* Entries flagged as anomalies frequently contain special dietary requests or constraints that are not accommodated by the current structured fields in the form.
* Users frequently provide detailed dietary instructions and participant-specific exceptions in the "OverallFeedback" column, suggesting no suitable fields for precise dietary or allergen information.
* Several anomalies highlight that dates for reminders are inconsistent and unclear, suggesting that users may not understand the purpose or format of the "ReminderDate" field.
* Numeric fields (e.g., "PreviousVersionsParticipated") contain textual descriptions, indicating ambiguity in field descriptions or validation.

**Potential User Workarounds:**

* Entering detailed meal preferences and dietary restrictions in the feedback or general text field.
* Using the "OverallFeedback" field to clarify conditional meal preferences (e.g., halal meat, wild-caught fish).
* Manually transforming text-based numeric data into numeric values (e.g., "not many" → 1, "all" → 5).
* Specifying allergies or special dietary conditions in free text areas due to the absence of structured allergy information fields.

**Feature Request:**
Title: Enhanced Structured Input for Meal Preferences and Dietary Restrictions

**Description:**
Currently, the registration form lacks structured inputs to capture detailed dietary preferences and constraints such as allergy specifics, halal requirements, vegetarian/vegan preferences, and conditional dietary rules. Users are resorting to free-text feedback fields to communicate essential dietary information, creating inconsistencies and complicating logistics management.

Implement additional structured fields to clearly capture:

* Dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher, pescatarian).
* Allergies (with an option to specify allergens explicitly).
* Conditional meal preferences (e.g., type of fish, halal meats, exclusion of specific ingredients).

Additionally, clarify the use and expected format of ambiguous fields such as "ReminderDate" and "PreviousVersionsParticipated," including adding validation and tooltips to guide proper data entry.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Users will have clearly defined input fields to specify dietary preferences, allergies, and special conditions.
* Data entry will be standardized, reducing ambiguity and user workarounds.
* Information captured will facilitate better logistical planning and participant satisfaction.
* The "ReminderDate" and numeric fields will have clear guidelines and validation, eliminating inconsistent data entry.
