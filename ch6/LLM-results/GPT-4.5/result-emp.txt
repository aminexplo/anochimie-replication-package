**Analysis:**

* The anomalies indicate users frequently encounter constraints related to missing fields or restrictive dropdown selections.
* Users explicitly documented workarounds, such as manually entering seniority in position titles, adding multiple phone numbers in one field, using incorrect placeholders (e.g., "Fan" instead of "A/C"), and approximating job start dates.
* Users flagged limitations regarding color selections, remote work hours input, multiple phone number fields, workplace amenities (specifically lack of an "A/C" option), and seniority levels for positions.

**Potential User Workarounds:**

* Manually entering seniority (e.g., "SENIOR" or "JUNIOR") directly in the "PositionTitle" field.
* Using alternative amenities (e.g., "Fan") when "A/C" is unavailable.
* Entering multiple phone numbers in a single field due to lack of multiple phone number support.
* Entering approximate or arbitrary dates when precise start dates are unavailable.
* Selecting random or approximate colors due to lack of precise selection tools.
* Converting negative remote hours to positive values assuming typographical errors.

Title: Enhancements to Employee Onboarding Form to Improve Data Accuracy and User Experience

**Description:**
The current employee onboarding form has multiple limitations causing inconsistent or incorrect data entry:

* Lack of dedicated options for seniority (Junior/Senior).
* Missing multiple-phone-number fields.
* Missing "A/C" option in workplace amenities.
* Inflexible date selection (e.g., no option for vague future start dates).
* Inaccurate color input using only a palette picker.
* Inadequate validation for remote working hours.

These limitations lead users to apply multiple workarounds, reducing data quality and consistency.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Include explicit options or checkboxes for seniority (Junior/Senior) within position titles.
* Add support for multiple phone number entries clearly labeled (e.g., Phone 1, Phone 2, etc.).
* Introduce "A/C" as a selectable amenity under Workplace Amenities.
* Allow flexible date inputs such as "TBD," "in X years," or an approximation feature with reminders for updates.
* Replace the color palette with a dropdown or pre-defined color picker for consistency.
* Add validation and correction options for remote working hours, clearly alerting users to negative or unrealistic inputs.
