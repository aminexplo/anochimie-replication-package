**Analysis:**  
- The flagged anomalies in the employee onboarding form data suggest that users are entering information in unconventional ways due to limitations in the form's design. For example, multiple phone numbers are being entered in a single field, and additional details such as "A/C" (presumably air conditioning) are being mentioned in the feedback or workplace amenities fields. Users are also manually entering job titles like "SENIOR" or "JUNIOR" despite these not being part of the predefined dropdown options. Similarly, users are entering imprecise job start dates or colors not supported by the input format.  

**Potential User Workarounds:**  
- Entering multiple phone numbers in the single available phone number field.  
- Manually entering job titles not available in the dropdown list (e.g., "SENIOR Software Engineer").  
- Mentioning additional workplace amenities like "A/C" in the feedback or existing amenity fields.  
- Entering approximate or relative job start dates (e.g., "In three years") in the date field.  
- Using the color input field to represent a color not supported by the predefined options.  

**Feature Request:**  
Title: Enhance Employee Onboarding Form Flexibility  

**Description:**  
The current employee onboarding form lacks flexibility in handling various real-world scenarios, leading to users employing workarounds that result in flagged anomalies. To improve data entry and accuracy, the following enhancements are needed:  

1. **Multiple Phone Numbers:** Add fields to accommodate more than one phone number per employee.  
2. **Expanded Workplace Amenities:** Include "A/C" as an option in the workplace amenities field.  
3. **Flexible Job Titles:** Allow users to either select from a broader range of predefined job titles (including "SENIOR" and "JUNIOR" prefixes) or enter custom job titles.  
4. **Improved Date Handling:** Enable more flexible job start date entry, such as accepting relative dates (e.g., "3 years from today") or providing an "TBD" (To Be Determined) option.  
5. **Color Selection:** Simplify color selection by providing a dropdown list of standard colors or allowing hex code input.  

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Users should be able to enter multiple phone numbers with separate fields.  
- The workplace amenities field should include "A/C" as an option.  
- Users should be able to select or enter job titles with prefixes like "SENIOR" or "JUNIOR."  
- The job start date field should allow relative or approximate entries.  
- Users should be able to select colors from a predefined list or enter a hex code.
