**Analysis:**  
- The flagged anomalies suggest that users are entering additional or special information in the "OverallFeedback" field, such as detailed meal preferences or special instructions for certain participants.  
- The "PreviousVersionsParticipated" field contains non-numeric entries, which are later interpreted or adjusted by the users in the feedback section.  
- The "ReminderDate" column contains a wide range of dates, indicating potential misuse or misunderstanding of its intended purpose.  
- Users are listing multiple topics of interest in the "TopicOfInterest" field, separated by "|", which may not be consistently processed or interpreted by the system.

**Potential User Workarounds:**  
- Entering detailed or special meal preferences and other participant-specific notes in the "OverallFeedback" field.  
- Interpreting non-numeric entries in "PreviousVersionsParticipated" and explaining transformations in the feedback section.  
- Using the "OverallFeedback" field to list multiple topics of interest for participants when the system does not support multiple selections natively.  
- Entering a wide range of dates in "ReminderDate", potentially due to a lack of clear guidance on its intended use.

**Feature Request:**  
Title: Enhance Conference Registration Form to Accommodate Detailed Participant Preferences

**Description:**  
The current conference registration form lacks the ability to capture detailed participant information, such as specific meal preferences, multiple topics of interest, and other special instructions. Users are currently employing workarounds by entering this information in the "OverallFeedback" field, leading to inconsistent data entry and potential issues in processing this information systematically.  

To address this, the following enhancements are proposed:  
1. Add a "Special Meal Preferences" field with an option for detailed text input to capture specific dietary needs (e.g., "Pasta - without mushrooms", "Meat - Just lamb", "Fish - only if wild-caught").  
2. Allow multiple selections or free-text entry for the "TopicOfInterest" field to accommodate participants with multiple interests.  
3. Clarify the purpose of the "ReminderDate" field and provide guidance or constraints on its use to ensure consistent date entries.  
4. Include a field for "Number of Previous Versions Participated" that can accept both numeric and categorical inputs (e.g., "Not many", "All"), with optional guidance or dropdown options to help standardize entries.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Users should be able to enter detailed meal preferences and special instructions for participants in a structured format.  
- The system should support multiple topics of interest for each participant and store them consistently.  
- The "ReminderDate" field should be used appropriately, with clear guidance on its purpose to avoid misuse.  
- The system should allow flexible entry for "Previous Versions Participated" while maintaining the ability to process and analyze the data effectively.
