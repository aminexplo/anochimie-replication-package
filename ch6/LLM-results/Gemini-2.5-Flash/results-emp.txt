**Analysis:**
- The flagged anomalies suggest several issues with the employee onboarding form. The most common anomalies are the presence of multiple phone numbers in a single field, the use of text fields to add `SENIOR` or `JUNIOR` titles that aren't available in the dropdown, and attempts to enter specific workplace amenities like `A/C` that are not listed as options.
- The **OverallFeedback** field consistently contains detailed notes, including lists of other employees who share similar characteristics or require specific amenities. This indicates that users are actively using this field to store structured data and missing information that the form's fields can't capture.

**Potential User Workarounds:**
- Concatenating multiple phone numbers into a single **PhoneNumber** field, often using hyphens, commas, or other delimiters.
- Manually typing in job titles like `SENIOR Designer` or `JUNIOR Software Engineer` in the **PositionTitle** field because the available dropdown options are too restrictive.
- Leaving the **WorkplaceAmenities** field blank or selecting a similar, but incorrect, option (e.g., `Fan` instead of `A/C`) and then noting the correct request in the **OverallFeedback** field.
- Using the **OverallFeedback** field as a general data-dump to record information that doesn't fit into any other field, such as lists of other employees with similar statuses, precise job start dates, or specific amenity requests.

**Feature Request:**
Title: Enhance Employee Onboarding Form to Support Multiple Inputs and Structured Data

**Description:**
The current employee onboarding form is overly restrictive, forcing users to input multiple data points—such as multiple phone numbers, custom job titles, and specific workplace amenity requests—into a single, free-text field. This leads to inconsistent data entry, making it difficult to search, filter, and report on employee information accurately.

To resolve this, we need to enhance the form to support a more flexible and structured data entry process. This includes adding dedicated fields for multiple phone numbers, allowing for more specific job titles (e.g., Senior/Junior), and expanding the list of available workplace amenities.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The **PhoneNumber** field should allow users to add and store multiple phone numbers for a single employee.
- The **PositionTitle** field should be updated with a more comprehensive list of titles, or allow for a prefix (e.g., Senior, Junior) to be added to existing titles.
- The **WorkplaceAmenities** field should be updated to include more options, such as `A/C`, to accurately reflect employee requests.
- The **OverallFeedback** field should not contain structured, comma-separated lists of other employees or dismissed information.
